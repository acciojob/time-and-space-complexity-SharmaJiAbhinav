	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that 
		describes the time required to execute an algorithm.
		The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time 
		it takes for each statement to complete. As a result, 
		it is highly dependent on the size of the processed data.
	   .Logarithmic time algorithm is considered highly efficient, as 
		the ratio of the number of operations to the size of the input
		decreases and tends to zero when n increases.
</p>

	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used 
		by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for
		execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an 
		algorithm O(n) – linear complexity – takes space directly 
		proportional to the input size. O(n log n) – log-linear/quasilinear 
		complexity – also called “linearithmic”, its space complexity grows 
		proportionally to the input size and a logarithmic factor.</p>
